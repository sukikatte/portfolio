        <h2>The Designer's Mindset</h2>
        
        <p>
            I'm a software engineer with a passion for creating technology that truly resonates with people. 
            My journey began with functional programming, but evolved into a deep exploration of how systems 
            can be designed to serve human needs.
        </p>
        
        <h2>My Design Philosophy</h2>
        
        <p>
            <strong>功能为基、体验为魂</strong> — Functionality is the foundation, experience is the soul. 
            I believe that powerful technology becomes meaningful only when it connects authentically with users. 
            Every line of code, every interaction, every visual element should serve the ultimate goal: 
            creating systems that people find intuitive, enjoyable, and empowering.
        </p>
        
        <blockquote>
            "Years of playing music taught me how timing shapes emotion — a principle I now apply to designing 
            intuitive user flows. Drawing trained my eye for visual balance, which guides my interface design decisions."
        </blockquote>
        
        <h2>Beyond Code</h2>
        
        <p>
            My interests in music and visual arts aren't separate from my technical work — they inform it. 
            Music teaches rhythm and emotional pacing. Art teaches composition and visual hierarchy. 
            These disciplines come together in every project I create, helping me build experiences that 
            feel both technically sound and humanly resonant.
        </p>
        
        <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
        
        <p>
            I'm particularly drawn to projects that bridge multiple domains: technology and education, 
            systems and creativity, functionality and delight. Whether building a wildlife conservation 
            platform or a real-time multiplayer game, I focus on creating experiences that are 
            innovative, user-centered, and meaningful.
        </p>
